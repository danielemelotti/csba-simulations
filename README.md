# Objective
This is the second project belonging to the series on Computational Statistics in Business Analytics (CSBA). The project aims to deepen the understanding of statistical concepts through the creation and analysis of simulated datasets. It focuses on exploring different types of distributions, understanding the behavior of mean and median in these contexts, examining standard deviation and quartiles, and investigating different methods for determining histogram bin sizes.

# Dataset
A few datasets are used in this project; each of them is created artificially along the project.

# Tasks
## 1. Generate and Visualize Artificial Distributions
* Generate Distribution 2 (negatively skewed) and Distribution 3 (normal distribution).
* Plot density graphs for the two distributions, marking the mean and median.
* Discuss which measure of central tendency would be more affected by the addition of outliers to the data, mean or median?
