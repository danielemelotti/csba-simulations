# Objective
This is the second project belonging to the series on **Computational Statistics in Business Analytics (CSBA)**. The project aims to deepen the understanding of statistical concepts through the creation and analysis of simulated datasets. It focuses on exploring different types of distributions, understanding the behavior of mean and median in these contexts, examining standard deviation and quartiles, and investigating different methods for determining histogram bin sizes.

# Dataset
A few datasets are used in this project; each of them is created artificially along the project.

# Tasks
## 1. Generate and Visualize Artificial Distributions
* Generate Distribution 2 (negatively skewed) and Distribution 3 (normal distribution).
* Plot density graphs for the two distributions, marking the mean and median.
* Discuss which measure of central tendency would be more affected by the addition of outliers to the data, mean or median?

## 2. Standard Deviations
* Create rdata, plot its density, and mark mean and standard deviations.
* Calculate and identify the quartiles and their distance to the mean in terms of standard deviations.
* Repeat with an adjusted dataset to see the effect of changing mean and standard deviation.
* Compare the positioning of quartiles in the skewed distribution from Distribution 2 and 3 with Distribution 1.

## 3. Histogram Binning
* Summarize different binning methods: Sturges', Scott's and Freedman-Diaconis.
* Apply the methods above to calculate bin widths and number of bins for a randomly distributed dataset (name it _rand_data_).
* Add outliers to _rand_data_ and repeat the analysis. Discuss what method is least sensitive to outliers.
